# Tasks / Roadmap

- Validate local dev: `npm ci && npm run dev` and `npm run build`.
- Configure external tool URLs in settings (OWUI, Penpot, Flowise, Excalidraw, ComfyUI) and update CSP accordingly.
- Review CI workflows under `.github/workflows/` and confirm Azure SWA token secret is present.
- Add light component tests if needed (none present today).
- Document any future architectural changes in `docs/DECISIONS.md` and log milestones in `docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md`.
